Efficient geometric perturbation theory with virtual density and sensitivity theory (draft)
===========================================================================================

A (draft) paper authored by Jeffrey E. Seifried.

Overview
--------

I started this work in early 2013, but was unable to finish it.
By combining virtual density theory, sensitivity theory, the new tools in MCNP6, and a hack, I proposed a means of simulating **any number** of simultaneous spatially dependent dimensional perturbations with a **single** transport calculation and a linear summation of material density sensitivities.
Please feel free to continue this work so that its great utility may be shared with the Nuclear Engineering community!
